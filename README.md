# Modeling atom lasers from Bose-Einstein condensates

Markov sampling method for calculation of the frequency comb spectrum for a quantized field in an external confinement at ultra-cold temperatures. The Python orthogonal_source.py calculates the 
frequency comb spectra of superimposed wave fields (atomic lasers) released from a magneto-optical trap.
